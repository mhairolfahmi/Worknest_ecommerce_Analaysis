## Project Background
Worknest is an e-commerce company specializing in furniture, office supplies, and technology products, serving both individual consumers and corporate clients.

This project analyzes Worknest’s sales dataset to uncover targeted insights into sales trends and product performance for 2024, with comparisons drawn against data from 2021, 2022, and 2023.. These insights are intended to support the Sales and marketing departments in refining strategies, optimizing performance, and driving overall business growth.

The goal is to study key performance metrics across this two core domain:

* Sales trends: An analysis of historical sales data from 2021 to 2024 to find patterns in total sales, total orders and average order value. The dataset was further segmented by region to evaluate regional sales performance and to identify the top-performing countries by sales.

* Product Performance: An evaluation of historical sales data from 2021 to 2024 was carried out to assess the sales performance of each product category and to identify the top products contributing the highest revenue for the company.

## Executive Summary
Worknest demonstrated an outstanding sales performance in 2024 with a total yearly sales of $4.30 millions. This represents  a 26% increase  compared to the previous year. This performance was primarily  fueled by a rise in order volume by about 27% despite the minor decrease in average order value of 0.53% at $504.  

This strong performance was a result of excellent sales contributions from both the home market and key international regions in Asia Pacific(APAC) and Europe(EU), across all three of our core product categories: furniture, office supplies, and technology products.

## Recomendation

* Focusing on high-performing products.
  * Highlight top sub-category and top products especially Canon imageCLASS 2200 Advanced Copier on our homepage websites and sales platform.
  * Under the office supplies category, bundle low contributors products (envelopes, fasteners and labels) with top contributors(appliances, storage) to improve our average order value

* Optimize regional sales funnels
  * The Sales and Marketing teams should collaborate to introduce localized campaigns, discounts, or product bundles that align with customer preferences in specific regions, particularly across APAC, the EU, and the United States.
  * We can further focus on localized campaigns in other top countries besides the United States, such as Australia and France.
  * Strengthen sales coverage in APAC and reinforce the EU growth with regional specific sales targets.
    
 * Content Strategy for Off-Peak Sales Period
   * Use the low demand period in Jan  to May to produce engaging media content that highlights our company and its products on social media to build audience interest ahead of our peak sales month.
