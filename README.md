# Worknest  Ecommerce Analaysis (2021-2024)
## Project Background
Worknest is an e-commerce company specializing in furniture, office supplies, and technology products, serving both individual consumers and corporate clients.

In this project, we analyze Worknestâ€™s sales dataset from 2021 to 2024 to generate targeted insights on sales trends and product performance. These insights are intended to support the Sales and marketing departments in refining strategies, optimizing performance, and driving overall business growth.

The goal is to study key performance metrics across this two core domain:

* Sales trends: An analysis of historical sales data from 2021 to 2024 to find patterns in total sales, total orders and average order value. The dataset was further segmented by region to evaluate regional sales performance and to identify the top-performing countries by sales.

* Product Performance: An evaluation of historical sales data from 2021 to 2024 was carried out to assess the sales performance of each product category and to identify the top products contributing the highest revenue for the company.
